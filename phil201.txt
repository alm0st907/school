    argumentative reasoning

    logos:
        root for logic, ancient greek word. Means

    issue: a claim up for dispute

    argument: just a set of sentances (conclusion/premises)
              conclusion supported by the premises

        deductive arguments (good arguments)
            do the premises adequately support the conclusion

        property of validty
            validy is reserved for arguments
            is it valid or invalid
                sentances are true or false
                arguments are valid or invalid

            propositions = truthfullness
            arguments = validty

        validty is used in deductive arguments
            an argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true if the premises are true
        

        examples:
            1) if its raining then the streets are wet
            2) its raining
            ------------------------------------------
            (conclusion) [therefore] the streets are wet

            this is a good deductive argument

    sentance: a set of symbols that expresses a proposition

    proposition: something that is true or false
        if its neither, not a proposition
        you dont have to know the answer for it to be a proposition

    
        example: 
            Where's my beer? (not a proposition)
            This is my beer. (proposition)
            Drink this beer. (not a proposition)
            2+2=4 (proposition) True
            2+2=5 (proposition) false
            2+3   (not a proposition) without the equals sign, does not equate to a proposition, merely just a statement

    Doxastic: logic/reasoning about beliefs
        we all have Doxastic attitudes (we believe a claim/ we believe the denial of a claim)

    assume the correspondance theory of truth

    believe/deny/suspend
        you can believe something, but it doesnt change its truth or falseness
