    argumentative reasoning

    logos:
        root for logic, ancient greek word. Means

    issue: a claim up for dispute

    argument: just a set of sentances (conclusion/premises)
              conclusion supported by the premises

        deductive arguments (good arguments)
            do the premises adequately support the conclusion

        property of validty
            validy is reserved for arguments
            is it valid or invalid
                sentances are true or false
                arguments are valid or invalid

            propositions = truthfullness
            arguments = validty

        validty is used in deductive arguments
            an argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true if the premises are true
        

        examples:
            1) if its raining then the streets are wet
            2) its raining
            ------------------------------------------
            (conclusion) [therefore] the streets are wet

            this is a good deductive argument

    sentance: a set of symbols that expresses a proposition

    proposition: something that is true or false
        if its neither, not a proposition
        you dont have to know the answer for it to be a proposition

    
        example: 
            Where's my beer? (not a proposition)
            This is my beer. (proposition)
            Drink this beer. (not a proposition)
            2+2=4 (proposition) True
            2+2=5 (proposition) false
            2+3   (not a proposition) without the equals sign, does not equate to a proposition, merely just a statement

    Doxastic: logic/reasoning about beliefs
        we all have Doxastic attitudes (we believe a claim/ we believe the denial of a claim)

    assume the correspondance theory of truth

    believe/deny/suspend
        you can believe something, but it doesnt change its truth or falseness
    


Date 1-11:
    mike likes beer  (this is a proposition)
        many to one relationship
        many to many relationship?
    
    sometimes a sentances has more than one proposition
        "propstitutes appeal to pope"
            theres two meanings to this- ambiguity
                does the pope like whores or are they making a "legal" appeal
        "childs stool- great for gardening"


    (1) conclusion
    (2) set of premises


    WHAT MAKES A GOOD ARGUMENT
        1) do the premises (if true) support the conclusion
        2) are the premises true?

    philosophers are the smartest in the humanities

    NOTE: USING *** as conclusion denotation; IFF means if and only it

    mike and hillary are here today
    -------------------------------
    ***hillary is here today

        this is a boring argument but it is valid and sound for the sake of example
        the argument has two properties
            the argument has validity - an argument is valid iff imposible to have true premises and false conclusion


    hopalicious is a good beer per the professor

    Mike does not like any beer
    hopalicious is a beer
    ---------------------------
    ***mike doesnt like hopalicious

        this argument is valid even though it is false, because the premises would support the conclusion (mike actually loves beer)
            there is a false premise therefore a false conclusion
    

    Everyday of recorded history the sun has risen in the east
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    *** tomorrow the sun will rise in the east

        argument is "true" but invalid, this is deductive rather than an argument. There is a possibility that tomorrow the sun could not rise in the east, however unlikely


    FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PRINCE OF DARKNESS


    valid argument because false false:
        2+2=5
        -----------------
        MIKE is your FNPOD



    Mike teaches at WSU or he teaches at madision (1)
    mike does not teach at madision               (2)
    ---------------------------------------------
    ***mike teaches at WSU



    study counter examples- just prove the conclusion could be false

    homeworks are graded easier than exams sort of
        dont take this as false confidence for the exams

    first exam in two weeks

    1) rex is a hot dog
    2) hot dogs taste great with mustard and relish 
    -----------------------------------------------
    rex tastes great with mustard and relish

        big problem is ambiguity in terminology, non equivocating on hot dog(s)

    natural language is semi ambigious in nature and relies on context to convey meanings properly
        its best to avoid ambiguity in arguments as much as possible

        "formal language" - the language of logic generally fits into certain forms
    

    modus ponens

        1) if its raining streets are wet
        2) its raining
        -----------------------------
        streets are therefore wet

    sentance variables
        P,Q,R,S,T

    atomic sentance is a simple sentace that expresses an idea
        only simple sentances get a letter?

    connectives
        & is our and symbol in here
        v is the or symbol
        antecedent -> consequivent 
        biconditional <--> biconditional
        ~ is the not symbol

    puncuation

    WFF
        acronym for WELL FORMED FORMULA - *KNOW THIS*

        1)a sentances variable by itself is a WFF
        2)if [] is a WFF then ~[] is a WFF
        3)if [] and (triangle) are WFF, then [] & (triangle) is a WFF
        4)[] and (triangle) are WFFs, then 
            bunch of other shit I wont write down
    i am dying; plz send help

date 1-18
    necessary vs sufficient condtions
        truth of p guaruntees truth of Q

    translate arguments, provide a key with them

    logical operations

    neither hilary nor  mike is a professor (yet)
    
    h= hillary is a professor
    m= mike is a professor

    ~(h v m) [this is the correct translation]
    ~h & ~m  [ also correct]
    ~(h & m) [wrong]
    ~h v ~m [wrong]

    but is and
    
date 1-23
    exam next thursday
    homework next tuesday
    try not to dispute

    look at translation schemes

    truth tables

    denial of a sentance is just adding or removing a tilde (~)

    true -> false IS ALWAYS FALSE
    false -> true is nearly always true

    truth tables

    3 atomic sentances TT

    can nearly always drop the outside parenthesis

    main connectives are generally the one with least parenthesis after dropping
    choose the least binding if more than one in same general area

    P Q R |(P->R) & (RvQ)   |
-----------------------------------
    t t t |  t    t    t    |
    t t f |  t    t    t    |
    t f t |  f    f    t    |
    t f f |  f    f    f    |
    f t t |  t    t    t    |
    f t f |  t    t    t    |
    f f t |  t    t    t    |
    f f f |  t    f    f    |

     the main connective determines the overall truth of the statement


    arrow is the main connective

    P Q  | P    -> Q v ~Q
    t t  | t    t  t t  f
    t f  | t    t  f t  t
    f t  | f    t  t t  f
    f f  | f    t  f t  t


    this is a tautology (always true)

    sentace that is always false is a contradiction

    contingent can be either

    EXAM NOTES FOR EXAM 1 ON THURSDAY 

    IF THERE IS NO KEY MAKE ONE
        why is part 2, num 4 b?

        binding of connectives
            most to least
            ~
            & V
            ->
            <-->

             if reverses the conditions
