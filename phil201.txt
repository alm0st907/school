    argumentative reasoning

    logos:
        root for logic, ancient greek word. Means

    issue: a claim up for dispute

    argument: just a set of sentances (conclusion/premises)
              conclusion supported by the premises

        deductive arguments (good arguments)
            do the premises adequately support the conclusion

        property of validty
            validy is reserved for arguments
            is it valid or invalid
                sentances are true or false
                arguments are valid or invalid

            propositions = truthfullness
            arguments = validty

        validty is used in deductive arguments
            an argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true if the premises are true
        

        examples:
            1) if its raining then the streets are wet
            2) its raining
            ------------------------------------------
            (conclusion) [therefore] the streets are wet

            this is a good deductive argument

    sentance: a set of symbols that expresses a proposition

    proposition: something that is true or false
        if its neither, not a proposition
        you dont have to know the answer for it to be a proposition

    
        example: 
            Where's my beer? (not a proposition)
            This is my beer. (proposition)
            Drink this beer. (not a proposition)
            2+2=4 (proposition) True
            2+2=5 (proposition) false
            2+3   (not a proposition) without the equals sign, does not equate to a proposition, merely just a statement

    Doxastic: logic/reasoning about beliefs
        we all have Doxastic attitudes (we believe a claim/ we believe the denial of a claim)

    assume the correspondance theory of truth

    believe/deny/suspend
        you can believe something, but it doesnt change its truth or falseness
    


Date 1-11:
    mike likes beer  (this is a proposition)
        many to one relationship
        many to many relationship?
    
    sometimes a sentances has more than one proposition
        "propstitutes appeal to pope"
            theres two meanings to this- ambiguity
                does the pope like whores or are they making a "legal" appeal
        "childs stool- great for gardening"


    (1) conclusion
    (2) set of premises


    WHAT MAKES A GOOD ARGUMENT
        1) do the premises (if true) support the conclusion
        2) are the premises true?

    philosophers are the smartest in the humanities

    NOTE: USING *** as conclusion denotation; IFF means if and only it

    mike and hillary are here today
    -------------------------------
    ***hillary is here today

        this is a boring argument but it is valid and sound for the sake of example
        the argument has two properties
            the argument has validity - an argument is valid iff imposible to have true premises and false conclusion


    hopalicious is a good beer per the professor

    Mike does not like any beer
    hopalicious is a beer
    ---------------------------
    ***mike doesnt like hopalicious

        this argument is valid even though it is false, because the premises would support the conclusion (mike actually loves beer)
            there is a false premise therefore a false conclusion
    

    Everyday of recorded history the sun has risen in the east
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    *** tomorrow the sun will rise in the east

        argument is "true" but invalid, this is deductive rather than an argument. There is a possibility that tomorrow the sun could not rise in the east, however unlikely


    FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PRINCE OF DARKNESS


    valid argument because false false:
        2+2=5
