    argumentative reasoning

    logos:
        root for logic, ancient greek word. Means

    issue: a claim up for dispute

    argument: just a set of sentances (conclusion/premises)
            conclusion supported by the premises

    sentance: a set of symbols that expresses a proposition

    proposition: something that is true or false
        if its neither, not a proposition
        you dont have to know the answer for it to be a proposition

    
        example: 
            Where's my beer? (not a proposition)
            This is my beer. (proposition)
            Drink this beer. (not a proposition)
