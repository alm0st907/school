    chapter 1:nutrition

    attendance code 2337

    nutrient - substance in foods for use by the body for energy, maintenance
        regulation of chem processes
        nutrient classifications - essential, non essential, conditionally essential
            organic or inorganic
                organic - contains carbon and hydrogen

            macro or micro nutrient

    organic doesnt really mean much
        certified organic, 100% organic, etc

    organic prodcuts arent inheriently any more nutritous
        differences are insignificant

    phytochemical - plantbased nutrient that is beneficial to people
    zoonutrient - animal nutrient beneficial to people

    functional foods
        nutritional scientists dont like the term
        its a fairly logical term however
            it is disliked because most food is to some extent functional

    carbohydrates
        CH2O
            glucose to cells (ATP)
            fiber promotes digestive health

    proteins
        source of energy
        composes most structures of the body
        allows us to move and stuff

    lipids - fats
        dense energy source
        composes structure of cell membranes
        "keto-acidosus"

    water
        important
        ~60% of body weight on average

    ENERGY IS NOT A NUTRIENT (exam question)
        capacity of a physical system to do work

    caloric content of foods
        carbs- 4 kcal/gram
        proteins - 4 kcal/gram
        lipds - 9 kcal/gram
        alcohol - (not nutrient) 7 kcal/gram - drink more beer
            CPL 449

        1 Calorie = 1 kcal = 1000 calories

    this is normal basic diet guidlines, not for body building or etc
        45-65% kcal from carbs
        10-35% from proteins
        20-35% from lipids

    be able to do the basic calculation for the exam

DATE 1-18:
    something something, close to lowest answer for calorie calculation for homework.
        cengage has an error so just roll with it

    simple vs complex relationships

    placebo effect

    researcher bias

    control group

    random assignment
        minimizes experimental error

    blinding

    hawthorne effect
        phenomenon in which study results are influenced by alteration
        of something that is not related to the actual study intervention

    3 major health risk factors

        tobacco use
        lack of physical activity
        ...diet?

        nutrition transition

        diabetes is from "nutritional advancment" lol okay.

date 1-23:
    prevalence of t2 diabetes
    once of prevention is worth a pound of the cure

    CHAPTER 2 nutritional assessment

    primary malnutrition
        inadequate diet
    secondary malnutrition
        due to illness, drug interaction, etc
            celiac disease is a secondary malnutrition
    anthropometric measurements
        weight, height, distribution of fat, lean mass, minerals
        advantages of these measurements:
            easy and inexpensive
        disadvantages
            not a diagnostic by itself
            nutritional factors make it dificult to interpret

    BMI
        equal to weight/height
        18.5-24.9 kg/m^2 is healthy

    biochemical measurements
        blood, urine, etc

    clinical assessment
        medical history
            weight loss/gain
            surgeries
            medications
            fam history

        symptops assessed

    retrospective vs prospective
        prospective is current
        restro is past

    DRI - dietary reference intakes
        EAR- estimated average requirements
        RDA-recommended dietary allowances
        AI- adequate intake leveles
        UL- tolerable upper intake levels

    Energy evaluation
        estimated energy requirement (EER)
        acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges
            AMDR


    DRI's are different for everybody
        differs for
            age
            physiological conditions
            sex
            10 groups for men, 16 for women


    DRA 19430-> DRI 1994

    EAR meets about 50% of population?

    RDA is 97%
    AI is a firect measure

    EER- estimated energy requirement
        age
        weight
        height
        sex
        physical activity level

date 1-25
    this class sucks ass
    regular vs qualified claim
        regular is verified
        qualified is less so

date 1-30
    test next tuesday
    active transport requires energy to move substances across cell membranes
    segmentation- mixin yo shit up
    peristalsis - waaavyyy movements
    cephalic phase- thought smell and sight of food stimulates CNS
    gastric - the food in yo shit
        digestive secretions and motility in stomach
    intestinal phase
        release of food into small intestine
        motility and secretions in stomach decrease

    mastication
        begins digestion
    secretions of saliva
        assist with swallowing
